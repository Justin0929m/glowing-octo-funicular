My name is Justin Scholtz, I am an aspiring front end web developer, I got a good understanding of the HTML and CSS tho I am currently upskilling myself with JavaScript. Once
I get a good understanding of JavaScript then I would like to move onto React as my JS framework. 

Web development has become a crazy passion of mine because it drives me insane and gives me such great satisfaction at the same time which is crazy to me. My main goal is 
to land my first front end developer career and work my way up the ladder to a senior front end developer, I would like to be the person everyone looks fo advice and to teach
those that needs it. I hope my story caught your attention and I hope to hear from you soon.
